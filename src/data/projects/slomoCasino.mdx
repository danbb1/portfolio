### Slomo Casino

#### Web Design and Development

[wwww.slomocasino.com](https://www.slomocasino.com)

Slomo Casino are a recently founded band in Stockport and I was tasked with building their website from scratch. The brief was to create a site that acted a hub for their online presence with links to social media and music platforms, advertising band activity such as upcoming shows and new releases, and online merchandise sales.

As a new band, their budget was tight and they wanted a site that could grow with them. So services with generous free tiers like Netlify and MailChimp and PAYG like Stripe were perfect.

Design was also important to them and in keeping with the casino theme I developed a custom mobile menu resembling a hand of cards unfolding as seen in the video below.

I also developed a novel way of showcasing their videos using a interactive slot machine, again keeping with the casino theme. A demo can be seen below or played on the site [here](http://www.slomocasino.com/watch/). At the time of writing Slomo Casino had only released a single video, however, as more are released they will be added to the wheel and matching 3 will set that video to play in the iframe.
