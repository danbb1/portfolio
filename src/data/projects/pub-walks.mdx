# Pub Walks

[https://nifty-nightingale-710f41.netlify.app/](https://nifty-nightingale-710f41.netlify.app/)

_TLDR:_

- Built with Gatsby
- Netlify Functions
- Typescript
- MongoDB
- Redux Toolkit
- Leaflet JS
- Tailwind CSS

Pub Walks is a mapping app that can be used to explore outdoor routes and see nearby pubs.

Routes can be plotted via user input or an uploaded GPX file. They are stored on a MongoDB Atlas cluster.

The pubs data came from a [https://www.getthedata.com/open-pubs](https://www.getthedata.com/open-pubs), representing 50,000+ pubs across the UK. I entered these into a local Mongo instance using a NodeJS script for development and testing, before exporting to an Atlas cluster.

Mapping functionality is provided by Leaflet JS and React Leaflet.

State is managed using Redux Toolkit.
