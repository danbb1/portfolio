# JS Games

[https://determined-sinoussi-d144ea.netlify.app/](https://determined-sinoussi-d144ea.netlify.app/)

*TLDR:*
- Static site
- Built with 11ty
- Nunjucks templating
- Vanilla JS
- Styled with conventional CSS enhanced with PostCSS
- HTML5 Canvas games

This is a small collection of HTML5 Canvas games built with vanilla JavaScript. I originally wrote these in Python as part of [Rice University's Fundamentals of Computing]("https://www.coursera.org/specializations/computer-fundamentals#courses"). For this project I have rewritten them in JavaScript and added a GUI (which was initially provided in the course).

Each game has a Board class that manages the game's state and handles user input. After each input, the canvas is redrawn to reflect the changes to state.
