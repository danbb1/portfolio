# Jonny Ball Guitar

## Web Design and Development

[wwww.jonnyballguitar.com](https://www.jonnyballguitar.com)

Jonny Ball is a guitar teacher who moved to teaching online during the pandemic. Seeing this as an opportunity to widen his audience he wanted to expand his web presence from social media only to a dedicated website.

The brief was to create a personal website to attract new students. Visitors should have the ability to enquire about lessons and buy gift vouchers.

Working with Dan meant that I was able to design my website from scratch, exactly how I wanted it, alongside Dan’s guidance and suggestions to create a site that was completely unique and bespoke. He accommodated my every request punctually and I wouldn’t hesitate in recommending him to anyone. Look no further than Dan Bridges!"
