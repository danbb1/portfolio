# Windows 98 Profile

The idea behind this project was explore state managment using Redux. As I had content available from my existing portfolio I thought that would be suitable to reuse and reimagine my portfolio if it was stored on a retro Windows Desktop.

The Redux store manages an array of open programs which are mapped onto a <Program /\> component displayed in the desktop. Each program window is resizeable, draggable, minimizable and maximizable. 

The content displayed within the program window is managed within a 'file system' JSON that acts as a linked list. Each node tracks its parent node and any child nodes, if they exist. If the node is a file, the node points to this file in the file structure.

Using Gatsby's data layer, the file system is queried using GraphQL and rendered.
