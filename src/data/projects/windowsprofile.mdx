# Windows 98 Profile

*Warning: this does not currently work on mobile. Screen sizes were much bigger in 1998.*

The idea behind this project was explore state managment using Redux. As I had content available from my existing portfolio I thought that would be suitable to reuse and reimagine my portfolio if it was stored on a retro Windows Desktop. This also had the benefit of recreating a design from a spec.

The Redux store manages an array of open programs which are mapped onto a <Program /\> component displayed in the desktop. Each program window is resizeable, draggable, minimizable and maximizable, with the state of these attributes recored in the redux store.

The content displayed within the program window is managed within a linked list that acts as a file system. Each node tracks its parent node and any child nodes, if they exist. If the node is a file, the node points to this file in the file structure.

Using Gatsby's data layer, the file system is queried using GraphQL and stored in a redux store.

Directories in the filesytem list their parent and child nodes, allowing for navigation within the explorer window. Files are written in MDX and GraphQL allows this file to queried to fetch the data, linking it to the file.
