# Hello, I'm Dan Bridges.

I’m a frontend-focused software developer based in Buxton, specialising in building production-ready web applications with modern tools and frameworks. I enjoy designing performant, maintainable systems and taking ownership of complex projects from architecture to delivery.

Currently, I work as a Product Developer at Dept where I primarily as a contractor at eBay, where I:

- Lead development of an AI-driven email content system using LangChain, designing architecture and shipping daily features.
- Migrated a legacy Backbone.js app to React, improving maintainability and developer velocity.
- Reduced CI pipeline runtime by over 80% through parallelised testing, improving team feedback loops.
- Built proof-of-concept tools like a Figma plugin to streamline content workflows.

Otherwise I have worked on a number of internal tools used by several teams across the agency.

Although primarily front-end focused, I can work across the full stack and have hands-on experience with:

- **Frontend**: React, MobX, Tailwind, Material UI

- **Backend**: Node.js, GraphQL, Apollo, LangChain, LangGraph

- **Testing**: Jest, Cypress, Mocha, Enzyme, Testing Library

- **Tools & Workflow**: Git, Jira, Figma

I’ve also delivered freelance production projects, including websites for small businesses and bands, focusing on modern stacks like Gatsby, Tailwind, and Material UI.

I enjoy iterating on systems—whether that’s software or brewing my own beer—and pushing processes to be more efficient and effective. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me running in the Peak District with my rescued spaniel.
