# Hello, I'm Dan Bridges.

I am a self-taught web-developer based in Stockport. I began learning in August 2020 and have completed several courses including:

- [Parts 1 - 8 of University of Helsinki's Full Stack Open]("https://fullstackopen.com/")
- [Audited Courses 1 - 4 of Rice University's Fundamentals of Computing on Coursera]("https://www.coursera.org/specializations/computer-fundamentals#courses")

While learning I have undertaken several freelance <Link to="/#projects-anchor">projects</Link>, including:

In 2019 my partner and I decided we needed a change and planned to go to New Zealand. We were due to fly on 21st March 2020, a few days after New Zealand closed their borders (which are yet to reopen 18 months later) and the beginning of the first lockdown.

This was not an ideal position to be in (especially considering I was previously a travel agent and the travel industry appeared to be shut down until further notice).

After applying for several jobs and securing a few interviews, I got Covid and was unable to attend any of them.

After several weeks of hunkering down, when it became apparent that Coronavirus was only just beginning and not about to end any time soon, I decided that the disruption should be used as an opportunity rather than a setback. I was planning on having a life-changing experience in New Zealand, so why not use the time to change my life despite being confined to the UK?

So I signed up to Angela Yu's bootcamp on Udemy.
