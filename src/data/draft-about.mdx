# Hello, I'm Dan Bridges.

I am a self-taught web-developer based in Stockport. I began learning in August 2020 and have completed several courses including:

- [Angela Yu's Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp]("https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/")
- [Parts 1 - 8 of University of Helsinki's Full Stack Open]("https://fullstackopen.com/")
- [Audited Courses 1 - 4 of Rice University's Fundamentals of Computing on Coursera]("https://www.coursera.org/specializations/computer-fundamentals#courses")

While learning I have simultaneously undertaken several freelance <Link to="/#projects-anchor">projects</Link> that are currently in production, including:

- [Jonny Ball Guitar](http://www.jonnyballguitar.com)
- [Slomo Casino](http://www.slomocasino.com)

Learning has been an incredible challenge, but also incredibly satisfying.

## Here's how I got here:

In 2019 my partner and I decided we needed a change and planned to go to New Zealand. We were due to fly on 22nd March 2020, a few days after New Zealand closed their borders (which are yet to reopen 18 months later) and the day before the announcement of the first lockdown in the UK.

After several weeks of hunkering down, when it became apparent that Coronavirus was only just beginning and not about to end any time soon, I decided that the disruption should be used as an opportunity rather than a setback. I was planning on having a life-changing experience in New Zealand, why not use the time to change my life despite being confined to the UK?

### First Bootcamp

So I signed up to Angela Yu's bootcamp on Udemy. I took to it very quickly and was determined to establish a career within the industry.

I completed the course just as rumours of a second lockdown were surfacing. I moved on to the University of Helsinki's Fullstack Open, which focuses on React with NodeJS and Express to further my learning.

### Fullstack Open and React

The course was more challenging than Angela Yu's; there was far less handholding and, as the content is translated from Finnish, it could be a little difficult to understand. This, however, encouraged me to solve the (many) problems I encountered through independent research. This, I would come to learn was a vitally important skill when developing and helped me immensely in progressing from the 'tutorial hell' stage of learning web development to building my own projects. 

Once I completed the Fullstack Open course, I tinkered around with a few small projects and followed several tutorials. As the long winter lockdown was coming to a close, I felt ready to tackle larger projects and began seeking freelancing opportunities.

### First Steps into Production Projects

My first project was building a website for a guitar teacher that had migrated much of his business online during the pandemic. The site was built from scratch using Gatsby and Tailwind. This then led to a further project building the website for a newly formed band.
